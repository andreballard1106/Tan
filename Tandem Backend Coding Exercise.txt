Tandem Backend Coding Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to provide Tandem with insights into the candidate’s 
familiarity with coding a .net core API service. The candidate is welcome to cap their eAort 
to 4 hours and if the exercise is not complete by that point, we will evaluate the partially 
complete eAort. If the candidate wishes to spend more time to complete the exercise, that 
is also OK.
API Service Description
The API service should provide restful endpoints to create and get a user entity.
Post Entity Schema
{
“firstName”: “Matthew”,
“middleName”: “Decker”,
“lastName”: “Lund”,
“phoneNumber”: “555-555-5555”,
“emailAddress”: “matt@awesomedomain.com”
}
Get notes
The GET endpoint should allow for retrieval by email address. The GET endpoint does not 
need to allow for retrieval by any other properties. Though we asked for the create endpoint 
to take first, middle, and last names separately; we’d like the GET endpoint to just-in-time 
convert the name into a single field like this:
{
“userId”: “54c4e684-0a6a-449d-b445-61ddd12Ad3d”,
“name”: “Matthew Decker Lund”,
“phoneNumber”: “555-555-5555”,
“emailAddress”: “matt@awesomedomain.com”
}
Also note that I’m assuming the userId is generated as part of the POST operation.
Response codes
The candidate should brainstorm and code appropriate HTTP response codes for non￾success.
Data Store
The data store is at the candidate discretion 
Integration Tests
The solution should include an integration tests project with a reasonable number of tests 
to exercise the endpoints and prove their correctness, including some scenarios where 
non-success responses are expected. The candidate is welcome to provide a unit test 
project though the integration tests are what we’ll focus on. For the integration tests, 
please make actual HTTP calls from your tests into your service.
How to submit the code
Please host the code in a free code repo like GitHub make it publicly accessible, and 
provide a link to the
resulting repo.
Bonus Points
The following are not mandatory. Feel free to do these for “bonus points”.
- Dockerize the solution
- Domain Driven Design
- Swagger documentation of the endpoints
- Provide an endpoint to mutate/modify the user record
- Commit frequently so we see the candidate’s thought process
- Consider using some of our favorite libraries:
Dependency Injection Container Built-in Microsoft DI container
Mediator Pattern MediatR
Logging Candidate’s discretion
